      <p>
        The path to becoming a doctor begins with one of the most competitive exams in India — <strong>NEET (UG)</strong>. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we help aspiring medical students channel their passion into structured, result-oriented preparation.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding NEET</h2>
      <p>
        NEET primarily tests students on Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (Botany + Zoology). A strong understanding of NCERT concepts, accurate time management, and consistent practice are key to cracking this exam.
      </p>

      <h2>Strategic Study Plan</h2>
      <p>
        A disciplined routine that includes focused study hours, topic-wise coverage, and regular revisions is essential. We help students create personalized timetables and micro-plans that balance learning with testing.
      </p>

      <h2>Mastering NCERT</h2>
      <p>
        Since NEET is heavily based on NCERT textbooks, especially for Biology, we guide our students to master every line, diagram, and concept — ensuring no question feels unfamiliar in the exam hall.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice + Precision</h2>
      <p>
        Practice is key — but it must be paired with smart analysis. Through extensive question banks, previous year papers, and mock tests, we help students sharpen accuracy and speed.
      </p>

      <h2>Personalized Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        Our faculty not only teaches but also mentors each student. Regular feedback, doubt-clearing sessions, and motivational guidance help students stay mentally strong and exam-ready.
      </p>

      <h2>Our NEET Courses & Programs</h2>
      <p>
