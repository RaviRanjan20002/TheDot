      <p>
        Preparing for <strong>JEE (Main & Advanced)</strong> is a journey that demands dedication, smart strategy, and the right mentorship. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we help students navigate this challenging path with confidence and clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the Exam</h2>
      <p>
        JEE is not just about hard work; it’s about working smart. The Main exam tests your speed and accuracy, while Advanced checks your conceptual depth and problem-solving skills. Understanding the pattern is key to planning your preparation.
      </p>

      <h2>Structured Study Plan</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend a clear study plan that balances all three subjects — Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Breaking the syllabus into weekly goals and setting milestones helps students stay consistent and reduce last-minute stress.
      </p>

      <h2>Focus on Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of rote learning, focus on building strong concepts. Practice problems that challenge your understanding, and revise frequently to strengthen retention. Our modules at DOT ensure every topic is approached with depth and clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>Mock Tests & Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Regular mock tests help simulate the actual exam environment. But the real magic lies in analysis — identifying weak areas, correcting mistakes, and refining your strategy with every test.
      </p>

      <h2>Mentorship Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Having mentors who guide, motivate, and support you through highs and lows is crucial. At DOT, our experienced faculty not only teach but also mentor — ensuring no student feels lost in the crowd.
      </p>
