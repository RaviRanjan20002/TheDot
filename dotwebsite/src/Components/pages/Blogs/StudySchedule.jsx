      <p>
        A well-structured study schedule is one of the most powerful tools a student can have during their exam preparation journey. Whether you're preparing for IIT-JEE, NEET, or any other competitive exam, a good schedule helps you stay organized, motivated, and productive. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we guide students to study smart—not just hard.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Know Your Syllabus Thoroughly</h2>
      <p>
        Before you begin scheduling, ensure you know the complete syllabus. Categorize topics into: Easy, Moderate, and Difficult. This will help you allocate time based on priority and familiarity.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Break Your Day into Study Blocks</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of long, tiring hours, divide your day into 2–3 hour blocks with short breaks in between. The Pomodoro technique (25 mins study + 5 mins break) is great for maintaining focus without burnout.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Mix Subjects Smartly</h2>
      <p>
        Avoid studying the same subject for the entire day. Mix theory-heavy subjects with problem-solving ones. For example, study Physics in the morning, Biology in the afternoon, and revise Chemistry in the evening.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Schedule Revision and Mock Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Revision is key. Dedicate one day every week solely for revision and mock tests. This reinforces concepts and helps evaluate your progress. At The DOT Institute, we conduct regular mock exams to support this routine.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Include Buffer Time</h2>
      <p>
        Unexpected things happen—illness, travel, or mental fatigue. Build buffer hours or days into your schedule to manage disruptions without stress.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Track Your Progress</h2>
      <p>
        Keep a tracker or checklist of completed topics. It boosts motivation and helps identify areas that need extra attention. Small wins lead to big achievements!
      </p>

      <h2>7. Prioritize Sleep, Food & Relaxation</h2>
      <p>
        A study plan is effective only when your mind is fresh. Ensure you're sleeping at least 7 hours a night, eating nutritious food, and taking time for relaxation or hobbies. Balance builds consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating a study schedule is not just about managing time, but about managing your energy and focus. Stick to your plan, but don’t be afraid to adjust when needed. With discipline, planning, and the right support, success is inevitable.
