      <p>
        Cracking the IIT-JEE requires hard work, consistency, and smart planning. But even the most dedicated students can falter by falling into common traps that sabotage their success. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we believe learning what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what to do.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Ignoring NCERT Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Many aspirants jump straight into advanced reference books without mastering NCERT. This is a mistake. A strong NCERT foundation, especially in Chemistry and Physics, is critical for concept clarity and board-level questions.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Poor Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        Procrastination and lack of planning often lead to last-minute cramming. Without a study schedule and regular revisions, important topics may remain untouched. Create and follow a realistic timetable to stay on track.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Switching Books or Coaching Midway</h2>
      <p>
        Constantly changing study materials or coaching methods can cause confusion and lack of depth in understanding. Stick to a reliable source and master it. The DOT Institute recommends curated material tailored to your level.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Not Analyzing Mock Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Taking mock tests is good, but analyzing them is even better. Many students skip reviewing their mistakes and repeat them in real exams. Understand *why* you went wrong and how to improve.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Ignoring Weaker Subjects</h2>
      <p>
        Students often over-focus on their strengths while ignoring weak areas like Organic Chemistry or Mechanics. Balanced preparation is crucial—weak areas can pull down your overall rank.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Studying Without Breaks</h2>
      <p>
        Long, unplanned study hours can cause burnout and decrease retention. Taking short breaks between sessions helps in better concentration and mental refreshment.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Comparing with Others</h2>
      <p>
        Every student has a different learning curve. Avoid comparing your progress with peers—it creates unnecessary pressure and lowers self-confidence. Stay focused on your own path.
      </p>
