      <p>
        Preparing for NEET can be an intense and demanding journey, but with the right strategies, you can turn this challenge into an opportunity for success. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we’ve helped hundreds of students realize their dreams of becoming doctors. Here are the most effective strategies for NEET preparation that every aspirant should follow.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Understand the NEET Exam Pattern and Syllabus</h2>
      <p>
        Begin with a deep understanding of the NEET syllabus, which closely aligns with the NCERT curriculum for Classes 11 and 12. Focus on Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (Botany and Zoology). Know the topic-wise weightage and prepare a checklist to track your coverage.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Stick to NCERT First</h2>
      <p>
        Around 70-80% of the NEET paper is directly based on NCERT content, especially for Biology. Mastering every line of your NCERT books should be your first priority before moving to any reference books.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Create a Smart Study Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        Plan a daily timetable that includes time for reading theory, solving MCQs, revision, and mock tests. Focus on consistency rather than long hours. Your schedule should include subject rotation to avoid monotony.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Practice MCQs Daily</h2>
      <p>
        Solving objective questions daily builds your accuracy and speed. Use The DOT Institute’s practice material and online test series to stay in tune with the latest NEET trends.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Take Full-Length Mock Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Regular mock tests simulate the actual exam experience. They help manage time, reduce exam fear, and evaluate your preparation. Always analyze your performance to identify weak areas.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Strengthen Weak Topics</h2>
      <p>
        Identify topics you frequently get wrong and spend extra time understanding and practicing them. Seek help from mentors or watch concept videos provided by The DOT Institute faculty.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Make Revision Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Prepare short notes, formulas, and important points for each chapter. These notes are lifesavers during last-minute revisions and help with quick retention.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Stay Calm and Focused</h2>
      <p>
        Don’t compare your preparation with others. Trust your process, follow your strategy, and stay focused. Regular meditation or short walks can help you stay mentally fresh and reduce stress.
      </p>
