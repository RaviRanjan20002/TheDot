      <p>
        One of the key factors that separates top performers from average ones is not just intelligence — it's time management. In the journey of competitive exam preparation, knowing how to manage your time effectively can make all the difference. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we train students not only to master subjects, but also to master their time.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Time is Your Greatest Asset</h2>
      <p>
        Every student gets the same 24 hours. What matters is how you use them. Successful aspirants treat their time like money — budgeting it carefully, investing it wisely, and avoiding waste.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Plan with a Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Creating a clear and realistic timetable gives structure to your day. Break your syllabus into weekly and daily goals. Prioritize high-weightage topics and mix subjects to keep your brain engaged.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use the 50-10 Rule</h2>
      <p>
        Studying for long hours without breaks leads to fatigue and loss of focus. Use time blocks — study for 50 minutes, take a 10-minute break. This boosts retention and prevents burnout.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Track and Review Your Time</h2>
      <p>
        Just like reviewing your test performance, review how you spend your time. Were you productive? Did you complete your targets? Make adjustments weekly to improve.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Avoid the Trap of Multitasking</h2>
      <p>
        Focus on one subject, one topic at a time. Constant switching between subjects, apps, or distractions leads to shallow focus. Stay committed to one task during each study session.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Practice Time-Bound Tests</h2>
      <p>
        In exams like NEET and JEE, managing time during the paper is crucial. Regularly practice mock tests within the time limit to build speed, accuracy, and stamina.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Balance Study with Rest</h2>
      <p>
        Time management isn’t about studying every second. It’s also about scheduling sleep, physical activity, and leisure to keep your body and mind in top shape.
      </p>
