      <p>
        Mathematics is often considered the game-changer in the IIT-JEE examination. While Physics and Chemistry are crucial, it's Mathematics that truly tests your logic, speed, and problem-solving ability. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we guide students to not just learn math — but to master it.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Understand Concepts, Don’t Memorize</h2>
      <p>
        The IIT-JEE exam is designed to check your understanding, not your memory. Focus on learning the “why” behind formulas and the logic behind every solution. Conceptual clarity forms the foundation of mastery.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Practice Is the Ultimate Key</h2>
      <p>
        Math is not a spectator sport. Solve a variety of problems, from easy to difficult. The more problems you tackle, the more confident and faster you become. At The DOT Institute, our extensive problem sets challenge you just right.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Learn Multiple Approaches</h2>
      <p>
        Some problems can be solved in more than one way — algebraically, graphically, or through smart tricks. Explore different methods to build versatility and find shortcuts that save time during the exam.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Focus on High-Weightage Topics</h2>
      <p>
        Prioritize topics like Calculus, Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, and Probability, as they carry significant weight in the exam. Build a strong base here before moving on to niche topics.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Analyze Your Mistakes</h2>
      <p>
        Every incorrect solution is an opportunity to learn. Maintain an error log — a notebook of mistakes, wrong approaches, and weak areas. Revisit it regularly to avoid repeating them.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Time-Bound Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Solving problems accurately is important, but solving them quickly is equally critical. Practice mock tests in a timed environment to improve speed and boost exam temperament.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Strengthen the Basics</h2>
      <p>
        No matter how advanced the question is, the solution lies in the basics. Revise your NCERT and basic concept notes regularly to ensure your foundation is rock-solid.
