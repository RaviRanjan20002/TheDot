      <p>
        It's completely normal to feel nervous before an important exam — but when stress turns into anxiety, it can hurt your focus, memory, and performance. At <strong>The DOT Institute</strong>, we believe that academic excellence goes hand-in-hand with mental well-being.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Understand Your Anxiety</h2>
      <p>
        Exam anxiety is a response to fear — fear of failure, of letting others down, or not meeting expectations. The first step to overcoming it is acknowledging it without shame. You're not alone, and it’s okay to feel this way.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Practice Mindfulness and Deep Breathing</h2>
      <p>
        Simple breathing exercises can calm your nervous system instantly. Try deep breathing, meditation, or even short walks to reset your mind. Being present reduces overthinking and boosts concentration.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Create a Realistic Study Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Anxiety often comes from procrastination and last-minute panic. Having a structured study schedule makes you feel more in control. Break tasks into small, achievable goals — and celebrate progress.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Stay Physically Active</h2>
      <p>
        Exercise isn't just good for your body — it's powerful for your brain. Just 20–30 minutes of movement daily helps reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) and boosts mood-enhancing endorphins.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Sleep Is Non-Negotiable</h2>
      <p>
        Lack of sleep leads to poor memory, low focus, and increased stress. Aim for 7–8 hours of quality sleep, especially before your exam day. Avoid caffeine or screen time late at night.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Talk About It</h2>
      <p>
        Bottling up stress makes it worse. Share your worries with a teacher, friend, or mentor. At The DOT Institute, our faculty is always here to support you — not just academically, but emotionally too.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Avoid Negative Self-Talk</h2>
      <p>
        Your inner dialogue shapes your reality. Replace “I can’t do this” with “I am prepared and improving every day.” A positive mindset can drastically change how you approach exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, your value isn’t defined by a single exam. Keep things in perspective, take care of your mind and body, and believe in your efforts. With the right strategies and support, you can overcome exam stress and perform at your best.
